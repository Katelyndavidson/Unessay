Marriage and family was their destiny
Wear corsets
War was the way of rewriting the rules, manny women found themselves driven and inspired
Oil lantern beside the bed
Church on sunday, dress to impress
Gathered with other young women often 
Clothing included: dresses, coats
Accessories: baskets, flowers

Avoid everything masculine
Dont be seen in public often
Speak and write properly
Don't form friendships with men
Make no great intimacies with any body
Pride yourself in modesty 
Trust no female acquaintance
Places women often visited: parks, markets, church, bakery, florist, fabric shop

Game World:
Twitter. The character is exploring twitter and the “player” (twitter user) can follow along and interact with the character to learn more about her life (the life of a girl in the 1800s)
Text game
Twitter and the twitter bot interact because it is taking the historical character the bot is embodying and it is exploring twitter as a method of communications
It is combining a historical figure and modern technology
Presents the history in a way that people consume information in today's world, more likely that someone will follow along sineines twitter over reading their journal

Game World Elements:
A potential obstacle would be people commenting on the page, the boy could interact but then is this still the player agent convey their life if the 1800s or is it changing what it is saying to reflect modern time

Goals:
Share life experiences through twitter
The player agent is trying to educate people on what life was like in the 1800s by making them feel like they are living at the same time

Interactive way of learning how women lived in the 1800s
Introduces a feminist perspective because it is told from the perspective of a woman but the bot was also created by a women
Goal moving forward to to learn how to get the bot to interact historically correct with comments
